# oriented-AI-partition-search
A SageMath-based tool to enumerate undirected graphs and test whether they admit any orientation with an acyclic-independent (AI) partition. Supports constraints on degree, connectivity, and planarity.

The code is implemented in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and is designed to perform enumeration over graphs with specific properties, such as:

- Vertex count in a specified range,
- Degree constraints (min/max),
- Minimum vertex connectivity,
- Planarity checks,
- Classification by maximum degree (e.g., subcubic, subquartic).

## 🧠 Background

This code was developed in support of the master's thesis:
